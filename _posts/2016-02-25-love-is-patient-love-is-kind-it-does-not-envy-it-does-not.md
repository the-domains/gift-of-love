GIFT OF LOVE CONFINEMENT CENTER

Gift of Love Confinement Center is conceptualized by two lovely mums who are also sisters, to host all the mums and newborn babies with fun and joy in Miri, Sarawak. 

We are always believed that we are blessed to bless and every newborn is a blessing and hope to the family. Embracing such wonderful gift is all what we strive for.

# Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. (1 Corinthians 13:4, NIV)
